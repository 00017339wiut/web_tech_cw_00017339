moduleâ€™s requirements and does not represent an actual company or service
Done by student 00017339 for web technology course work.

I have choosen Westmisnter International University as the local organization/ company for this coursework and made a website for them.
The website has 6 pages in total, this includes the home, abous us, study at WIUT, news, campus life and contact us page.
Each page has a different layout and style (only the navigation bar and footer is the same across all pages).
The home page has a text and image, the about us page has squares with text, study page includes a text and image along with a table of available courses,duration and price
(disclaimer the duration and price of these courses are not the real prices, i have decided to use fake numbers for these sections due to privacy and security reasons).
The news section has a timeline of several events that were taken from the university's original website. The images in the campus life section are real photos of the university.
Finally the contact us page has a form that user needs to fill out to send their contact information to receive a call, after the form is filled and submitted there is a custom modal 
that pops up on the screen  confirming the submission of the form (disclaimer, the information used to fill out the form is not stored anywhere or received by anyone or anything).
